## Generation of depth and orientation fields

To generate depth and orientation fields, please refer to the documentation of the following repositories:

* [regiodesics](https://github.com/BlueBrain/regiodesics)
* [atlas-direction-vectors](https://github.com/BlueBrain/atlas-direction-vectors)
* [atlas-placement-hints](https://github.com/BlueBrain/atlas-placement-hints/)


## Flatmapping

Complete workflow to generate flatmaps and perform flatmap-based applications. For more details, please look at the [README](flatmap/README.md) under `flatmap`.


## Annotation of barrels and barrel columns 

Code needed to add barrel cortex annotations to the CCFv3 Allen Atlas at 10 $\mu m$ resolution. For more details, please look at the [README](barrel-annotations/README.md) under `barrel-annotations`.
