## Depth and orientation field generation

To generate depth and orientation fields, please refer to the documentation of the following repositories:

* [atlas-direction-vectors](https://github.com/BlueBrain/atlas-direction-vectors)
* [atlas-placement-hints](https://github.com/BlueBrain/atlas-placement-hints/)


## Flatmap

Complete workflow to generate flatmaps and perform flatmap-based applications. For more details find README.md in `flatmap`.


## Annotation of barrels and barrel columns 

Code needed to add barrel cortex annotations to the CCFv3 Allen Atlas at 10 $\mu m$ resolution. For more details find README.md in `barrel-annotations`.
